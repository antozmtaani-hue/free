Collections are stressful, but taking structured steps protects you and can lead to improved offers. Start by verifying the debt (request validation), then negotiate either a settlement or a payment plan. Use the sample scripts below to ask for verification, propose a settlement, or offer a small lump-sum payment in exchange for removal.

You should also watch the statute of limitations for your state and consider consulting low-cost legal aid if collection agents threaten litigation. Document all communications and always obtain written agreements before sending money.
