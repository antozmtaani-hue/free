If your credit needs work, this 90-day plan breaks the most impactful actions into weekly tasks. Week 1: pull reports, flag errors, and create a payment calendar. Week 2: contact creditors to negotiate fees or settle small balances. Weeks 3–6: execute payments to lower utilization and start any credit-builder accounts. Months 2–3: keep payments on time and monitor results.

Practical tips:
- Dispute incorrect tradelines immediately; attach supporting docs.
- Move high-utilization balances to lower-utilization cards or pay them down aggressively.
- Add a small, guaranteed installment or secured card and pay it on time.

Internal resources: our home guide (link: /), a deep dive on negotiating with collectors (link: /posts/handle-collections), and an FAQ on security freezes (link: /posts/credit-freezes).

Remember: improvements compound. A single removed error plus two months of lower utilization can change offers you qualify for.
