Welcome to Fresh Start Finance — a practical resource for people who have poor or damaged credit and are ready to rebuild. If you've been denied credit, hit with fees, or feel trapped by high interest, this site gives concise, realistic steps you can follow today. We focus on immediately actionable moves: checking reports, disputing errors, negotiating with creditors, and building positive activity that lenders notice.

Why this works: major credit decisions depend on recent activity and on-time payments. While long-term history matters, the fastest measurable improvements come from focused actions you take over the next 30–120 days. That includes correcting mistakes, lowering utilization, and adding small, reliably paid accounts.

Start with a three-step sprint:

1. Order your free credit reports and scan for errors. A single corrected item can boost your score.
2. Reduce credit-card utilization: pay down balances or move balances to a 0% or lower-utilization plan when possible.
3. Add an on-time payment record: a secured card, credit-builder loan, or authorized-user strategy can begin positive history immediately.

Below, you'll find guides, example dispute texts, and recommended next steps. We place trusted tools above the fold to help you act fast — use the Propeller slot at the top to access offers or calculators relevant to low-credit consumers.

We avoid get-rich-quick promises. Instead, we map concrete steps you can complete in a week, a month, and a quarter. If you need a plan tailored to your exact situation, check our posts and use the internal links for deeper walkthroughs.
